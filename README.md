JumpingSumo Control Library for Python


1. About this...
JumpingSumo is a small mobile robot produced by Parrot(http://www.parrot.com).
The SDK of this robot is already released on Github.com(https://github.com/Parrot-Developers).

This SDK is implemented for C-Language only, so I tried to ported it to Python.

2. Quick start

   1. Power on your JumpingSumo and connect to the Wifi connection of the robot.
   2. start Python
   3. load library 
     - >> import sumo

   4. create controller; cnt
     - >> cnt = sumo.SumoController('MyCtrl')

   5. connect to the robot
     - >> cnt.connect()

   6. call 'move' function to confirm connection...
     - >> cnt.move(10)

   7. stop moving
     - >> cnt.move(0)

   8. please try to activate 'move', 'action', 'jump', 'posture' functions...
     - cnt.move(speed, turn_spped) ; speed = [-100:100],turn_speed = [-100:100]
     - cnt.action(param)           ; param = [0:9] ~ enum[stop, spin, tap, slowshake, 
                                           metronome, oudulation, spinjump, spintoposture, spiral,slalom]
     - cnt.jump(param)             ; param = [0:1] ~ enum[long, high]
     - cnt.posture(param)          ; param = [0:2] ~ enum[standing, jumper, kicker]
  
   9. ... and when you are finished
     - >> cnt.terminate()
